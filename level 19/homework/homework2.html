    <p> Marshall Bruce Mathers III (born October 17, 1972), known professionally as Eminem (stylized as EMINÆŽM), is an American rapper and music producer.
    He is credited with popularizing hip hop in Middle America and is regarded as among the greatest rappers of all time.
    [3] His success is considered to have broken racial barriers to the acceptance of white rappers in popular music.
    While much of his transgressive work during the late 1990s and early 2000s made him a controversial 
    figure, he came to be a representation of popular angst of the American underclass and has been cited as
    influencing many musical artists. His most successful songs on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 include "The Real Slim Shady", 
    "Without Me", "Lose Yourself", "Not Afraid", "Love the Way You Lie", "The Monster", "Godzilla" and "Houdini".</p>
