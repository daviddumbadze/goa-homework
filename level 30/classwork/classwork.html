    Patrick Star is a fictional character in the American animated television series SpongeBob SquarePants.
     He is voiced by actor Bill Fagerbakke and was created and designed by marine biologist and animator Stephen Hillenburg.
      He first appeared in the series' pilot episode "Help Wanted" on May 1, 1999.
       In addition to his supporting role on SpongeBob SquarePants,
        Patrick also serves as the main protagonist of The Patrick Star Show, which premiered in 2021.[3]

An overweight coral-pink starfish,
 Patrick lives under a rock in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom, and is the best friend of SpongeBob SquarePants.
  His most significant character traits are his laziness and low intelligence, 
  although he occasionally shows that he is smarter than he seems. Patrick is unemployed and a self-proclaimed expert in the "art of doing nothing".

The character has received positive reactions from critics and fans alike.
 Patrick has been included in various SpongeBob SquarePants-related merchandise,
  including trading cards, video games, plush toys, and comic books. He is also a leading character in the three films based on the franchise.
